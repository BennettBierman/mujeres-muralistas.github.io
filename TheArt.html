					<h2>[Untitled] Balmy Alley Mural</h2>
					<p> This untitled mural was created by Irene Perez in 1973, using acrylic on wood. It was painted on the home of Patricia Rodriguez and like the majority of the murals painted on Balmy Alley in the 1970's, it can still be seen today. This is just a representation of one of the many less grandiose pieces Las Mujeres Muralistas created. They would often create smaller works in between making their larger projects. This simple piece depicting two boys playing flutes with soft blues and oranges evokes a balance and calmness appropriate for a painting covering one's home.</p>

					<h2>Latinoamerica</h2>
					<p> This piece was created in 1974 with acrylic on masonry on the corner of Mission and 25th Streets.  It was the very first large project created my Las Mujeres Muralistas.  It was commissioned by the Mission Model Cities organization - a group dedicated to helping those in need find economic prosperity.  Consuelo Méndez was approached by her friend who worked for the company if the newly founded group would be interested in painting a mural that would represent Latinos in the Mission District.  The group was commissioned $1000 to paint the 20-foot wall.  What was more impressive than this payday, was the media attention the group received.  It was clear that the work Las Mujeres Muralistas was doing represented a new generation of muralism in San Francisco - something that thrilled and angered many individuals.  The mural itself depicts the prosperity of different groups of Latinos throughout time.  Unfortunately, the piece was destroyed in the 1980's. </p>

					<h2>Para el Mercado</h2>
					<p> Para el Mercado was created in 1974 using acrylic on wood.  The painting is 10 x 76 feet and is located on 14th Street at South Van Ness, San Francisco.  The painting was originally designed by Graciela and Consuelo but was completed by all muralistas.  It was commissioned by a restaurant known as Paco's Tacos.  The owner of the restaurant wanted something that would unify the latino community and draw them in to support a local latino business rather than the new McDonalds opening around the corner.  To accomplish this goal, Las Mujeres Muralistas created a mural depicting men and women hunting, fishing, and preparing traditional Latino meals. People throughout time are seen interspersed throughout the market scenes.  It was a pure celebration of latino culture.</p>

					<h2>Rhomboidal Parallelogram</h2>
					<p> While this is perhaps a lesser known piece by the muralist collective, it highlights the fact that this group was not simply limited to painting brick walls on public streets.  For this project, the group, led by Consuelo Méndez and a non-core member, Ester Hernández, painted all six sides of this 3-D construction - a rhomboid parallelogram.  Each panel of the project was 7 x 7 feet and was made from acrylic on canvas.  With bright flashing colors, the work highlights the hardworking aspects of latino culture.  This structure is no longer standing today.  </p>

					<h2>Fantasy for Children</h2>
					<p> This mural was created with acrylic on wood in 1975.  The piece is 40 x 20 feet and is located in a small park between Five Markets Groceries and La Mexicana Bakery.  This park, only recently put up by the city after the bakery that once stood in its place burned down, was meant to be used for children and families to enjoy the space together.  However, before the mural was put up, the park was in bad shape; it was covered in beer and dog feces and appeared dilapidated.  A concerned member of the community and friend of Las Mujeres Muralistas, Michael Rios, proposed to town hall that an effort should be made to fix the park, which included the addition of a mural.  Las Muralistas were commissioned by the town to complete the mural and attempted to elevate the sensation that a child or family should feel when in a park.  The painting, which depicts an animal dotted jungle, indigienous fishermen, and an enormous volcano, utilizes vibrant tones to achieve this goal. </p>
