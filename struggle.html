					<p class = "banner style3 content-align-left">It is labrous to capture the importance of the fact that there was a group like Las Mujeres Muralistas and emphasize the obstacles they had to overcome; nonetheless, it must be done.  First and foremost, it must be restated that this group was the world’s first ever muralista collective.  While there were female muralists before them, they were the first to, as a single unit, combine their unique talents and interests to form a unified artistic body.
						<br>
						<br>
						The significance of the decision to form a group like this stems from several places.  First off, it must be understood that muralism was priorly known as a boys club.  As previously stated in the earlier section, the essential inventors of latino muralism were los Tres Grandes.  They set the style and themes that would be used in the artform for years to come.  Their art, and subsequently the art that would follow, was harsh.  It depicted war, violence, and hardship.  In bold bloody red it demonstrated the noticeably masculine side of Mexican nationalism. Due to this, for the next 50 years, including when Las Mujeres Muralistas’s contemporaries Jesus "Chuy" Campusano, Luis Cortazar, and Michael Rios created their classic “Homage to Siqueiros” at the same time and place as Las Muejres’s “Latinoamerica”, the artistic values of Los Tres Grandes were cemented.  Male artists and groups were undisputedly talented and creative, though for the most part, only within the range of style that Los Tres Grandes had left behind.  Due to stigma, it was believed that a woman could not and should not create art in this fashion, and therefore, latina muralista collectives did not form for this 50 year period.  For all tense and purposes, it was culturally understood that men alone should depict what they interpreted as the pain and pride of their home country.

						So, for half a century, this status quo was maintained, but it was not destined to last forever.  While Las Mujeres Muralistas were an incredible group who single handedly revolutionized an entire genre of art, they did not come from nowhere.  Beyond a knowledge of Los Tres Grandes, it is important to understand two elements that account for the prominence of Las Mujeres when they formed: the Chicano Art Movement and the Feminsit Movement.
						<br>
						<br>
						Firstly, let's discuss the Chicano Resistance and Art Movements.  While some believe this movement has existed since the time of Columbus, modern scholars deem that its practical start was in the 1960’s, around the same time the Black Power movement was growing in popularity.  The political aspect of the movement consisted of activists of Mexican descent demanding equal opportunity from institutions such as universities.  While quiet integration had perhaps been the trend of latino immigration into the U.S. for the first half of the 20th century, by 1960, this was no longer the case.  The Chicano population, after years of being systematically persecuted, began seeing the rough edges of American culture and the value of holding on to their own heritage.  Logically, the Chicano Art movement was an eruption of new and reinterpreted forms and mediums of art expressing the desires of the Chicano movement.  Despite stemming from the same movement, every artists’ background, politics, and beliefs were different, and this resulted in a wide range of artistic expression.  The movement was popular in predominantly latino and chicano neighborhoods, such as Las Mujeres Muralistas’s home in Mission District, San Francisco.  For about a decade prior to the emergence of Las Mujeres Muralistas, latino and chicano style art, despite not being fully received by academia, was thriving on the streets of major cities across the United States.  This is one side of the Mujeres’s story.

						The orther side of this coin is the Feminist movemnet.  While first-wave feminism had been prominent in the United States since the early 20th century, second-wave feminism, the movement that finally included women of color, did not realize until the 1960’s.  During this time, women not only began fighting for equality to men, but perhaps more importantly, began more thoroughly valuing womanhood.  Unlike some strains of modern feminism, feminists then wanted to express and embrace their difference from men.  It was around this time that feminist art as we know it, with pieces that forced the viewer to have conversations about the differences and similariteis of the sexes, and question why society treated the sexes in the manner in which it did, was becoming more popular.
						<br>
						<br>
						Essentially, these two movements together were the perfect environment to foster a group like Las Mujeres Muralistas.  However, that does not necessarily dictate that this group was bound to form.  Nonetheless, as chance would have it, four like-minded latina and chicana artists ended up at the San Francisco Art Institute.  The individuals were active members of both movements; instead of making feminist art that lacked heritage, or express the ideals of their culture while forgeting femininity, the group decided that they would create art that accomplished both tasks.  Honestly, this seems like a normal conclusion to make in a situation like this, but what is incredible about Las Mujeres Muralistas is the medium they chose to express themselves with, muralism.  The reason that this was shocking was because as aforementioned, this was probably the most masculine form of latino or chicano art that there was.  Women were usually deemed unfit to create this type of art in the first place, let alone change its themes and styles to fit the feminsit movement. However, it made no sense to Las Mujeres Muralistas that muralism, seemingly the most free medium of art, would be so tightly defined by gendered standards.  They thought why couldn’t the plight and joy of the female chicana experience be put on display.

						Well despite pretty negative responses by fellow male painters in the neighborhood, the group proceeded to create twelve large scale, and countless small scale, murals over the course of a decade.  They were literally the first ever female muralista collective to use classic latino muralism to express the thoughts and feelings of both the chicana and feminist movements - and for this they should be reveared.
