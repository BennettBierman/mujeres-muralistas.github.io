					<p class = "banner style3 content-align-left">It is difficult to pinpoint the exact influence of Las Mujeres Muralistas.  This is the case for several reasons.  First, artistic movements do not occur in a vacuum but are influenced by many different groups and people for many different reasons.  Therefore, it is hard to say whether a certain group was influenced by Las Mujeres Muralistas or one of their contemporaries.  For example, a prominent chicana arts and theatre group that also existed in the 1970’s was La Cucarachas.  Perhaps there are modern muralist groups today that are actually more inspired by La Cucarachas than Las Mujeres, or theatre programs more inspired by Las Mujeres than La Cucarachas.
						<br>
						<br>
					Despite this blurriness, given that Las Mujeres Muralistas were the first chicana muralista collective, it is safe to say that any such group that followed them were inspired if not by their art, then by their actions.  One such prominent group was the Co-Madres of the 1990’s.  While certainly a group with their own edgier style than Las Mujeres Muralistas, they were clearly a chicana muralista collective who expressed a feminist response to what followed the Chicano Movement.  This simply could not have happened without Las Mujeres Muralistas.  It seems that they will be most remembered as the key that unlocked latinx muralism to chicanas and any other female interested in that form of art.

						<p class = "banner style3 content-align-left"> 
						Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it seems that Las Mujeres Muralistas are not given the respect that they rightfully deserve.  As pivotal figures of both the second-wave feminist and chicano art movements, it is a shame that this group does not recieve the recognition that they desreve.  This group is known amongst certain academic and artistic circles, but it seems that this group's art and courage is too inspirational to only receive the little traction that they do.  Hopefully this website may be one step in changing this unfortunate reality.
