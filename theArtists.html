						Before diving into the crux of what the Mujeres Muralistas meant to the Mission District in San Francisco, the Chicano Movement, or latinx muralism as a whole, it is also important to understand who the prominent figures of this group were and where they came from.

					<h2>Patricia Rodriguez</h2>
					<p class = "p_size"> Patricia Rodriguez grew up in Marfa, Texas - a town that not so long ago was a part of Mexico.  Growing up as a Mexican-American and the daughter of immigrants in the 1950’s, Rodriguez was constantly told by others, including her own friends and family, that the only thing she could become was a day laborer or a wife.  However, this brutal misconception did not discourage Rodriguez from pursuing her one true passion, art.  Thankfully, despite not being permitted to start school until the age of twelve, after years of hard work and dedication to her craft, Rodrguiz received a scholarship to attend the San Francisco Art Institute.  Despite studying minimalism, the popular style of the time, Rodrguiz felt a desire to create works that were bigger, brighter, and more influential than the works she was creating for school.  It was not until Rodriguez more fully entered into the emerging chicano and latino art scene of the West coast did she finally find individuals who not only thought like her, but wanted to paint like her too.  Through school, art exhibits, and other means, Rodriguez found her group of fellow muralistas.  It was in her home on Balmy Alley that Las Mujeres Muralistas would meet up to plan their projects.  She is looked back upon as the leader and most pivotal member of the group.
					<br>
					<br>
					Today, Rodriguez is a professor of latino art and taught one of the first ever classes on chicano art.  She has taught at several universities across the West coast and continues to share her art with the world.  While her style today is more abstract than it once was, she still approaches her craft with the same passion that she has always had.  </p>

					<h2>Graciela Carrillo</h2>
					<p class = "p_size"> Graciela Carrillo was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.  With less restrictive parents than Rodriguez, she was encouraged to attend the California State University in San Jose to study art.  While intrigued by her courses, Carrillo, like her fellow Muralistas, was also offered and accepted a scholarship to attend the San Francisco Art Institute.  While at the same school with Rodriguez, the duo actually first met in 1969 at the University of California, Berkley’s Third World Student strike.  The duo immediately hit it off and would eventually become roommates at their university.  Carrillo was profoundly influenced by her instructor Malaquias Montoya, who introduced her to the Mexican American Liberation Art Front and the Chicano Art movement.  After Carrillo and Rodriguez later met up with Perez and Méndez, Carrillo played an enormous role, due to her knowledge of the larger movements taking place at the time, in shaping what the group’s artwork would look like and stand for.  
					Today Carrillo is an active member of academia who balances a life of creating and critiquing art. </p>

					<h2> Irene Perez</h2>
					<p class = "p_size"> Irene Perez was the youngest member of Las Mujeres Muralistas.  She was born and raised in Oakland, California.  Her mother, from Mexico, and her father, from Texas, were both farmworkers.  This largely impacted Las Mujeres Muralistas’s understanding of rural and underpaid labor.  Perez originally studied illustration and commercial art at the Academy of Art, though later studied printmaking at the San Francisco Art Institute.  Unfortunately, due to a complex circumstance concerning the termination of the school’s fee-wavier policy, Perez was unable to finish her degree.  Nonetheless, at her time at the university, she still managed to meet up with Graciela Carrillo and Patricia Rodriguez, allowing Las Mujeres Muralistas to form as we know it.  Not to mention, along with her God-given talent, these several years at university still managed to greatly benefit her craft.  After Las Mujeres Muralistas disbanded, and to this day, Perez and remained a constant creator of the arts.

					<h2>Consuelo Méndez</h2>
					<p class = "p_size"> Consuelo Méndez was the only member of the group who was not from the United States. Méndez was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1952.  Right from the beginning of her life, Méndez was heavily influenced by the arts.  Her father was a doctor and a painter who himself was heavily involved in the Mexican mural movement and leftist politics.  It was from a young age that Méndez fell in love with the arts from her father.  However, Méndez originally should not have been a part of the Las Mujeres Murlistas.  Despite her fondness of the arts, Méndez initially attended Rice University to pursue becoming a doctor, like her father.  However, after some time at the institution, Méndez transferred to the San Francisco Art Institute to pursue becoming an artist - again like her father.  Méndez eventually met up with the other Mujeres Muralistas at school, and by joining, cemented the core of the muralist group.  Today, like Rodriguez, Méndez’s art as shifted more towards a realm of abstractism, though the passion she has had since she was a little girl in Caracas still shines through her work.</p>
